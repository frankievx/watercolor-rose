# Watercolor Rose in React Three Fiber

## Notes
- User wants to recreate a watercolor rose effect in React Three Fiber.
- The effect should use custom shaders inspired by the Blender Eevee tutorial at https://sinestesia.co/blog/tutorials/watercolor-eevee/.
- Shader nodes from the Blender file/guide need to be adapted to GLSL or Three.js.

## Task List
- [ ] Review the referenced watercolor Eevee tutorial to understand the shader nodes and artistic approach.
- [ ] Set up a new React project with react-three-fiber and necessary dependencies (Three.js, glsl, etc).
- [ ] Plan how to translate Blender shader nodes to GLSL/Three.js for use in React Three Fiber.
- [ ] Implement the watercolor shader as a custom material in React Three Fiber.
- [ ] Model or import a rose mesh for rendering.
- [ ] Apply the shader to the rose mesh and tweak parameters for the watercolor effect.
- [ ] Test and refine the effect for realism and performance.

## Current Goal
Review the watercolor Eevee tutorial and shader nodes.
